# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Claude Code provider

When the user starts Claude Code with `./scripts/claude-deepseek.sh`, requests
are sent to DeepSeek's Anthropic-compatible endpoint. The launcher reads
`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` from the process environment, the ignored
`.claude/deepseek.env`, or the ignored root `.env`, in that order. Never copy
the key into this file, README, `.claude/settings.json`, logs, tests, or Git
history. The default primary model is `deepseek-v4-pro[1m]`; lightweight and
subagent calls use `deepseek-v4-flash`.

For the current milestone order and takeover checkpoint, read
`docs/CLAUDE_HANDOFF.md`. The project skills `/continue-rumorbuster` and
`/validate-rumorbuster` provide the standard resume and pre-commit workflows.

## Project Overview

### RumorBuster branch note

This repository branch is productized as **RumorBuster**. Its current on-disk
layout is flat (`app/`, `packages/`, and `frontend/` live at the repository
root), even though some upstream sections below still describe the historical
`backend/` layout. `compose.yaml` starts the Next.js frontend on port 3000,
LangGraph on 2024, and the Gateway on 8001.

The frontend Dockerfile copies dependency manifests before application source,
so ordinary UI edits reuse the cached dependency-install layer.

`rumor_agent` is the V3 explicit `StateGraph`; `rumor_agent_v2` preserves the
previous `create_agent` plus workflow-gate implementation for regression and
rollback. Keep both graph IDs and the existing API paths compatible. Each new
user turn gets a fresh `run_id` and must clear current-run evidence while
retaining checkpointed conversation history.

`config.example.yaml` enables the keyless DuckDuckGo `web_search` provider.
The V3 graph never exposes `web_search` to the extraction/explanation model.
After checkability, it fans out local HuggingFace/Chroma plus TF-IDF hybrid RAG, ordinary web research, a separate
deterministic timeline search/fetch branch, the optional classifier, and professional-domain `authority-researcher` with LangGraph
`Send`, then reducers fan in before normalization and deterministic
adjudication. `evidence-critic` has no tools and may only describe coverage or
threshold gaps; deterministic code runs a preliminary adjudication and allows
at most one supplement. Coverage alone is not enough when the available
evidence still misses the A / two-independent-B threshold.
A markerless claim's model-reported `current_status` temporality is
deterministically downgraded to `general` in `repair_temporality`; only
claims carrying explicit current markers (目前/现在/现行/最新/当前/截至)
keep the 365-day staleness rule for current-status evidence. The decision
threshold itself never changes.
After branch merge, `rescue_unverified_evidence` deterministically re-fetches
up to two observed A/B-grade direct evidence items the model left unfetched
or misquoted, and replaces the model excerpt with a verbatim sentence chosen
from the fetched content. This bounded step never lowers the A /
two-independent-B threshold; failed rescues leave items excluded.
The dense index is built explicitly with `scripts/build_rag_index.py` into
`runtime/`; live requests never download models or rebuild it. Missing or
mismatched dense indexes degrade to the checked-in sparse retriever. Retrieved
knowledge chunks are bounded explanation context and never current evidence
unless their source URL is fetched again and passes the normal evidence rules.
LangGraph Server may provide the active thread ID through runtime context,
`config.configurable`, or `config.metadata`; task delegation must preserve all
three fallbacks. A model may reduce a subagent's `max_turns`, but must never
increase the configured limit. Ordinary research has a 55-second timeout,
`web_search=1`, and `web_fetch<=4`; authority research has 55 seconds,
`web_search=1`, and `web_fetch<=2`; classifier timeout is 12 seconds.
Per-tool budgets are enforced by `ToolCallLimitMiddleware` (deny-and-
continue: the model receives an error ToolMessage and must emit its final
JSON within the remaining turns), so the model cannot burn every turn on
tool calls and leave no parseable result. Timeline
research does not run a model loop: code performs `web_search=1` followed by
up to five concurrent `web_fetch` calls; every returned item is code-locked to `timeline_only=true` and cannot participate in
adjudication. A ready timeline requires at least three distinct, dated,
fetched records and may be shown alongside an insufficient verdict with an
explicit non-verdict disclaimer. Captured `ToolMessage` values are the URL
provenance boundary. A successful structured
`web_fetch` result supplies the only trusted `fetched_at` for direct web
evidence; V3 binds it by normalized URL. Never trust a URL or fetch timestamp
that appears only in a subagent's final text.
NASA and IPCC are registered only for climate/Earth-science scope. Their URLs
must still pass directness, fetch, date, and claim-coverage checks; a registry
match alone never guarantees admission to the decision threshold.

The unpacked Chrome Manifest V3 extension lives in `browser-extension/`. Its
selection context-menu action opens `/workspace/chats/new` and passes the
selected claim and HTTP(S) source URL in the URL fragment, never the request
query. The frontend must prefill this content without auto-submitting it and
must immediately clear the fragment with `history.replaceState` after reading
it. Keep this privacy and explicit-confirmation contract when changing either
side of the integration.

`config.example.yaml` also enables the `web_fetch` provider for user-supplied
public HTTP(S) URLs. With `JINA_API_KEY` it prefers Jina Reader (page URLs
are sent to Jina); otherwise it uses a bounded local HTTP/readability fetch
that also extracts text from PDFs. The local fallback sends browser-like
headers, retries transient failures (429/5xx and connection errors, never
403/404 or read timeouts), follows up to five redirects, reports empty
readable bodies as errors so the research model tries the next candidate,
and defaults to a 12,000-character content bound. The V3 original-page node
may call `web_fetch` once per run before claim extraction.
`config.yaml` may alternatively bind `web_search`/`web_fetch` to the Tavily
community tools (`deerflow.community.tavily.tools`) with a free
`TAVILY_API_KEY`: Tavily fetches server-side (JS rendering, PDF extraction,
no datacenter-IP blocking) and its `web_fetch` returns the same structured
provenance contract as the local/Jina tool, so graph_v3 binding is unchanged.
Generic URL-only instructions such as "核验这个网页的主要内容" are not a
claim. Claim extraction first tries structured output, then a strict plain-JSON
fallback for providers that reject structured schemas; if both fail, request a
specific claim instead of searching the generic instruction.
The fetch tool must reject localhost/private/non-web targets and must return
structured JSON containing `source_url`, `fetched_at`, `title`, bounded
`content`, character counts, and truncation state. Reports must cite only URLs actually returned by
the current fetch/search calls, using standard clickable Markdown links, and
must include a deduplicated Sources section. A successful page read is not
independent confirmation of that page's claims. `RumorEvidencePolicyMiddleware`
enforces this after the final model call: it removes clickable URLs absent from
the current run's tool messages, restores a missing original-page source entry,
and downgrades the verdict to evidence-insufficient/low whenever the final
report cites no independently searched source. This middleware protects V2;
V3 performs the equivalent checks explicitly in `normalize_research` and
`finalize`, and deterministically renders a complete report even if the
explanation model fails.

V3 implementation entry points are
`packages/harness/deerflow/agents/rumor_agent/graph_v3.py`,
`packages/harness/deerflow/agents/rumor_agent/__init__.py`, and
`langgraph.json`. `SubagentExecutor` returns captured tool messages as well as
final text. Sandbox, Memory, historical `knowledge-analyst`, `rag-analyst`, and
`evidence-archiver` are not part of the V3 truth-decision path; do not describe
them as project algorithms or active voting agents.

Artifact downloads must use the explicit active-content suffix mapping in
`app/gateway/routers/artifacts.py`. Do not rely only on the host
`mimetypes` database for HTML/XHTML/SVG because Linux images may classify
`.xhtml` differently; active content must always be returned as an attachment.

`evaluation/v3_comprehensive_cases.json` is the fixed 40-case course manifest:
10 checkability, 8 RAG, 12 evidence/professional, 5 mixed-subclaim, and 5
URL/failure-routing cases. It references deterministic component fixtures and
must not be described as 40 live web runs. Run `scripts/evaluate_rumorbuster.py`
to validate every reference and regenerate category metrics.

DeerFlow is a LangGraph-based AI super agent system with a full-stack architecture. The backend provides a "super agent" with sandbox execution, persistent memory, subagent delegation, and extensible tool integration - all operating in per-thread isolated environments.

**Architecture**:
- **LangGraph Server** (port 2024): Agent runtime and workflow execution
- **Gateway API** (port 8001): REST API for models, MCP, skills, memory, artifacts, uploads, and local thread cleanup
- **Frontend** (port 3000): Next.js web interface
- **Nginx** (port 2026): Unified reverse proxy entry point
- **Provisioner** (port 8002, optional in Docker dev): Started only when sandbox is configured for provisioner/Kubernetes mode

## Important Development Guidelines

### Documentation Update Policy
**CRITICAL: Always update README.md and CLAUDE.md after every code change**

When making code changes, you MUST update the relevant documentation:
- Update `README.md` for user-facing changes (features, setup, usage instructions)
- Update `CLAUDE.md` for development changes (architecture, commands, workflows, internal systems)
- Keep documentation synchronized with the codebase at all times
- Ensure accuracy and timeliness of all documentation

## Commands

**Root directory** (for full application):
```bash
make check      # Check system requirements
make install    # Install all dependencies (frontend + backend)
make dev        # Start all services (LangGraph + Gateway + Frontend + Nginx), with config.yaml preflight
make stop       # Stop all services
```

**Backend directory** (for backend development only):
```bash
make install    # Install backend dependencies
make dev        # Run LangGraph server only (port 2024)
make gateway    # Run Gateway API only (port 8001)
make test       # Run all backend tests
make lint       # Lint with ruff
make format     # Format code with ruff
```

Regression tests related to Docker/provisioner behavior:
- `tests/test_docker_sandbox_mode_detection.py` (mode detection from `config.yaml`)
- `tests/test_provisioner_kubeconfig.py` (kubeconfig file/directory handling)

Boundary check (harness → app import firewall):
- `tests/test_harness_boundary.py` — ensures `packages/harness/deerflow/` never imports from `app.*`

CI runs these regression tests for every pull request via [.github/workflows/backend-unit-tests.yml](../.github/workflows/backend-unit-tests.yml).

## Architecture

### Harness / App Split

The backend is split into two layers with a strict dependency direction:

- **Harness** (`packages/harness/deerflow/`): Publishable agent framework package (`deerflow-harness`). Import prefix: `deerflow.*`. Contains agent orchestration, tools, sandbox, models, MCP, skills, config — everything needed to build and run agents.
- **App** (`app/`): Unpublished application code. Import prefix: `app.*`. Contains the FastAPI Gateway API and IM channel integrations (Feishu, Slack, Telegram).

**Dependency rule**: App imports deerflow, but deerflow never imports app. This boundary is enforced by `tests/test_harness_boundary.py` which runs in CI.

**Import conventions**:
```python
# Harness internal
from deerflow.agents import make_lead_agent
from deerflow.models import create_chat_model

# App internal
from app.gateway.app import app
from app.channels.service import start_channel_service

# App → Harness (allowed)
from deerflow.config import get_app_config

# Harness → App (FORBIDDEN — enforced by test_harness_boundary.py)
# from app.gateway.routers.uploads import ...  # ← will fail CI
```

### Agent System

**Lead Agent** (`packages/harness/deerflow/agents/lead_agent/agent.py`):
- Entry point: `make_lead_agent(config: RunnableConfig)` registered in `langgraph.json`
- Dynamic model selection via `create_chat_model()` with thinking/vision support
- Tools loaded via `get_available_tools()` - combines sandbox, built-in, MCP, community, and subagent tools
- System prompt generated by `apply_prompt_template()` with skills, memory, and subagent instructions

**ThreadState** (`packages/harness/deerflow/agents/thread_state.py`):
- Extends `AgentState` with: `sandbox`, `thread_data`, `title`, `artifacts`, `todos`, `uploaded_files`, `viewed_images`
- Uses custom reducers: `merge_artifacts` (deduplicate), `merge_viewed_images` (merge/clear)

**Runtime Configuration** (via `config.configurable`):
- `thinking_enabled` - Enable model's extended thinking
- `model_name` - Select specific LLM model
- `is_plan_mode` - Enable TodoList middleware
- `subagent_enabled` - Enable task delegation tool

### Middleware Chain

Middlewares execute in strict order in `packages/harness/deerflow/agents/lead_agent/agent.py`:

1. **ThreadDataMiddleware** - Creates per-thread directories (`backend/.deer-flow/threads/{thread_id}/user-data/{workspace,uploads,outputs}`); Web UI thread deletion now follows LangGraph thread removal with Gateway cleanup of the local `.deer-flow/threads/{thread_id}` directory
2. **UploadsMiddleware** - Tracks and injects newly uploaded files into conversation
3. **SandboxMiddleware** - Acquires sandbox, stores `sandbox_id` in state
4. **DanglingToolCallMiddleware** - Injects placeholder ToolMessages for AIMessage tool_calls that lack responses (e.g., due to user interruption)
5. **GuardrailMiddleware** - Pre-tool-call authorization via pluggable `GuardrailProvider` protocol (optional, if `guardrails.enabled` in config). Evaluates each tool call and returns error ToolMessage on deny. Three provider options: built-in `AllowlistProvider` (zero deps), OAP policy providers (e.g. `aport-agent-guardrails`), or custom providers. See [docs/GUARDRAILS.md](docs/GUARDRAILS.md) for setup, usage, and how to implement a provider.
6. **SummarizationMiddleware** - Context reduction when approaching token limits (optional, if enabled)
7. **TodoListMiddleware** - Task tracking with `write_todos` tool (optional, if plan_mode)
8. **TitleMiddleware** - Auto-generates thread title after first complete exchange and normalizes structured message content before prompting the title model
9. **MemoryMiddleware** - Queues conversations for async memory update (filters to user + final AI responses)
10. **ViewImageMiddleware** - Injects base64 image data before LLM call (conditional on vision support)
11. **SubagentLimitMiddleware** - Truncates excess `task` tool calls from model response to enforce `MAX_CONCURRENT_SUBAGENTS` limit (optional, if subagent_enabled)
12. **ClarificationMiddleware** - Intercepts `ask_clarification` tool calls, interrupts via `Command(goto=END)` (must be last)

### Configuration System

**Main Configuration** (`config.yaml`):

Setup: Copy `config.example.yaml` to `config.yaml` in the **project root** directory.

**Config Versioning**: `config.example.yaml` has a `config_version` field. On startup, `AppConfig.from_file()` compares user version vs example version and emits a warning if outdated. Missing `config_version` = version 0. Run `make config-upgrade` to auto-merge missing fields. When changing the config schema, bump `config_version` in `config.example.yaml`.

**Config Caching**: `get_app_config()` caches the parsed config, but automatically reloads it when the resolved config path changes or the file's mtime increases. This keeps Gateway and LangGraph reads aligned with `config.yaml` edits without requiring a manual process restart.

Configuration priority:
1. Explicit `config_path` argument
2. `DEER_FLOW_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable
3. `config.yaml` in current directory (backend/)
4. `config.yaml` in parent directory (project root - **recommended location**)

Config values starting with `$` are resolved as environment variables (e.g., `$OPENAI_API_KEY`).
`ModelConfig` also declares `use_responses_api` and `output_version` so OpenAI `/v1/responses` can be enabled explicitly while still using `langchain_openai:ChatOpenAI`.

**Extensions Configuration** (`extensions_config.json`):

MCP servers and skills are configured together in `extensions_config.json` in project root:

Configuration priority:
1. Explicit `config_path` argument
2. `DEER_FLOW_EXTENSIONS_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable
3. `extensions_config.json` in current directory (backend/)
4. `extensions_config.json` in parent directory (project root - **recommended location**)

### Gateway API (`app/gateway/`)

FastAPI application on port 8001 with health check at `GET /health`.

**Routers**:

| Router | Endpoints |
|--------|-----------|
| **Models** (`/api/models`) | `GET /` - list models; `GET /{name}` - model details |
| **MCP** (`/api/mcp`) | `GET /config` - get config; `PUT /config` - update config (saves to extensions_config.json) |
| **Skills** (`/api/skills`) | `GET /` - list skills; `GET /{name}` - details; `PUT /{name}` - update enabled; `POST /install` - install from .skill archive (accepts standard optional frontmatter like `version`, `author`, `compatibility`) |
| **Memory** (`/api/memory`) | `GET /` - memory data; `POST /reload` - force reload; `GET /config` - config; `GET /status` - config + data |
| **Uploads** (`/api/threads/{id}/uploads`) | `POST /` - upload files (auto-converts PDF/PPT/Excel/Word); `GET /list` - list; `DELETE /{filename}` - delete |
| **Threads** (`/api/threads/{id}`) | `DELETE /` - remove DeerFlow-managed local thread data after LangGraph thread deletion; unexpected failures are logged server-side and return a generic 500 detail |
| **Artifacts** (`/api/threads/{id}/artifacts`) | `GET /{path}` - serve artifacts; active content types (`text/html`, `application/xhtml+xml`, `image/svg+xml`) are always forced as download attachments to reduce XSS risk; `?download=true` still forces download for other file types |
| **Suggestions** (`/api/threads/{id}/suggestions`) | `POST /` - generate follow-up questions; rich list/block model content is normalized before JSON parsing |

Proxied through nginx: `/api/langgraph/*` → LangGraph, all other `/api/*` → Gateway.

### Sandbox System (`packages/harness/deerflow/sandbox/`)

**Interface**: Abstract `Sandbox` with `execute_command`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `list_dir`
**Provider Pattern**: `SandboxProvider` with `acquire`, `get`, `release` lifecycle
**Implementations**:
- `LocalSandboxProvider` - Singleton local filesystem execution with path mappings
- `AioSandboxProvider` (`packages/harness/deerflow/community/`) - Docker-based isolation

**Virtual Path System**:
- Agent sees: `/mnt/user-data/{workspace,uploads,outputs}`, `/mnt/skills`
- Physical: `backend/.deer-flow/threads/{thread_id}/user-data/...`, `deer-flow/skills/`
- Translation: `replace_virtual_path()` / `replace_virtual_paths_in_command()`
- Detection: `is_local_sandbox()` checks `sandbox_id == "local"`

**Sandbox Tools** (in `packages/harness/deerflow/sandbox/tools.py`):
- `bash` - Execute commands with path translation and error handling
- `ls` - Directory listing (tree format, max 2 levels)
- `read_file` - Read file contents with optional line range
- `write_file` - Write/append to files, creates directories
- `str_replace` - Substring replacement (single or all occurrences)

### Subagent System (`packages/harness/deerflow/subagents/`)

**Built-in Agents**: `general-purpose` (all tools except `task`) and `bash` (command specialist)
**Execution**: Dual thread pool - `_scheduler_pool` (3 workers) + `_execution_pool` (3 workers)
**Concurrency**: `MAX_CONCURRENT_SUBAGENTS = 3` enforced by `SubagentLimitMiddleware` (truncates excess tool calls in `after_model`), 15-minute timeout
**Flow**: `task()` tool → `SubagentExecutor` → background thread → poll 5s → SSE events → result
**Events**: `task_started`, `task_running`, `task_completed`/`task_failed`/`task_timed_out`

### Tool System (`packages/harness/deerflow/tools/`)

`get_available_tools(groups, include_mcp, model_name, subagent_enabled)` assembles:
1. **Config-defined tools** - Resolved from `config.yaml` via `resolve_variable()`
2. **MCP tools** - From enabled MCP servers (lazy initialized, cached with mtime invalidation)
3. **Built-in tools**:
   - `present_files` - Make output files visible to user (only `/mnt/user-data/outputs`)
   - `ask_clarification` - Request clarification (intercepted by ClarificationMiddleware → interrupts)
   - `view_image` - Read image as base64 (added only if model supports vision)
4. **Subagent tool** (if enabled):
   - `task` - Delegate to subagent (description, prompt, subagent_type, max_turns)

**Community tools** (`packages/harness/deerflow/community/`):
- `tavily/` - Web search (5 results default) and web fetch (4KB limit)
- `jina_ai/` - Web fetch via Jina reader API with readability extraction
- `firecrawl/` - Web scraping via Firecrawl API

**ACP agent tools**:
- `invoke_acp_agent` - Invokes external ACP-compatible agents from `config.yaml`
- ACP launchers must be real ACP adapters. The standard `codex` CLI is not ACP-compatible by itself; configure a wrapper such as `npx -y @zed-industries/codex-acp` or an installed `codex-acp` binary
- Missing ACP executables now return an actionable error message instead of a raw `[Errno 2]`
- Each ACP agent uses a per-thread workspace at `{base_dir}/threads/{thread_id}/acp-workspace/`. The workspace is accessible to the lead agent via the virtual path `/mnt/acp-workspace/` (read-only). In docker sandbox mode, the directory is volume-mounted into the container at `/mnt/acp-workspace` (read-only); in local sandbox mode, path translation is handled by `tools.py`
- `image_search/` - Image search via DuckDuckGo

### MCP System (`packages/harness/deerflow/mcp/`)

- Uses `langchain-mcp-adapters` `MultiServerMCPClient` for multi-server management
- **Lazy initialization**: Tools loaded on first use via `get_cached_mcp_tools()`
- **Cache invalidation**: Detects config file changes via mtime comparison
- **Transports**: stdio (command-based), SSE, HTTP
- **OAuth (HTTP/SSE)**: Supports token endpoint flows (`client_credentials`, `refresh_token`) with automatic token refresh + Authorization header injection
- **Runtime updates**: Gateway API saves to extensions_config.json; LangGraph detects via mtime

### Skills System (`packages/harness/deerflow/skills/`)

- **Location**: `deer-flow/skills/{public,custom}/`
- **Format**: Directory with `SKILL.md` (YAML frontmatter: name, description, license, allowed-tools)
- **Loading**: `load_skills()` recursively scans `skills/{public,custom}` for `SKILL.md`, parses metadata, and reads enabled state from extensions_config.json
- **Injection**: Enabled skills listed in agent system prompt with container paths
- **Installation**: `POST /api/skills/install` extracts .skill ZIP archive to custom/ directory

### Model Factory (`packages/harness/deerflow/models/factory.py`)

- `create_chat_model(name, thinking_enabled)` instantiates LLM from config via reflection
- Supports `thinking_enabled` flag with per-model `when_thinking_enabled` overrides
- Supports `supports_vision` flag for image understanding models
- Config values starting with `$` resolved as environment variables
- Missing provider modules surface actionable install hints from reflection resolvers (for example `uv add langchain-google-genai`)

### IM Channels System (`app/channels/`)

Bridges external messaging platforms (Feishu, Slack, Telegram) to the DeerFlow agent via the LangGraph Server.

**Architecture**: Channels communicate with the LangGraph Server through `langgraph-sdk` HTTP client (same as the frontend), ensuring threads are created and managed server-side.

**Components**:
- `message_bus.py` - Async pub/sub hub (`InboundMessage` → queue → dispatcher; `OutboundMessage` → callbacks → channels)
- `store.py` - JSON-file persistence mapping `channel_name:chat_id[:topic_id]` → `thread_id` (keys are `channel:chat` for root conversations and `channel:chat:topic` for threaded conversations)
- `manager.py` - Core dispatcher: creates threads via `client.threads.create()`, routes commands, keeps Slack/Telegram on `client.runs.wait()`, and uses `client.runs.stream(["messages-tuple", "values"])` for Feishu incremental outbound updates
- `base.py` - Abstract `Channel` base class (start/stop/send lifecycle)
- `service.py` - Manages lifecycle of all configured channels from `config.yaml`
- `slack.py` / `feishu.py` / `telegram.py` - Platform-specific implementations (`feishu.py` tracks the running card `message_id` in memory and patches the same card in place)

**Message Flow**:
1. External platform -> Channel impl -> `MessageBus.publish_inbound()`
2. `ChannelManager._dispatch_loop()` consumes from queue
3. For chat: look up/create thread on LangGraph Server
4. Feishu chat: `runs.stream()` → accumulate AI text → publish multiple outbound updates (`is_final=False`) → publish final outbound (`is_final=True`)
5. Slack/Telegram chat: `runs.wait()` → extract final response → publish outbound
6. Feishu channel sends one running reply card up front, then patches the same card for each outbound update (card JSON sets `config.update_multi=true` for Feishu's patch API requirement)
7. For commands (`/new`, `/status`, `/models`, `/memory`, `/help`): handle locally or query Gateway API
8. Outbound → channel callbacks → platform reply

**Configuration** (`config.yaml` -> `channels`):
- `langgraph_url` - LangGraph Server URL (default: `http://localhost:2024`)
- `gateway_url` - Gateway API URL for auxiliary commands (default: `http://localhost:8001`)
- Per-channel configs: `feishu` (app_id, app_secret), `slack` (bot_token, app_token), `telegram` (bot_token)

### Memory System (`packages/harness/deerflow/agents/memory/`)

**Components**:
- `updater.py` - LLM-based memory updates with fact extraction, whitespace-normalized fact deduplication (trims leading/trailing whitespace before comparing), and atomic file I/O
- `queue.py` - Debounced update queue (per-thread deduplication, configurable wait time)
- `prompt.py` - Prompt templates for memory updates

**Data Structure** (stored in `backend/.deer-flow/memory.json`):
- **User Context**: `workContext`, `personalContext`, `topOfMind` (1-3 sentence summaries)
- **History**: `recentMonths`, `earlierContext`, `longTermBackground`
- **Facts**: Discrete facts with `id`, `content`, `category` (preference/knowledge/context/behavior/goal), `confidence` (0-1), `createdAt`, `source`

**Workflow**:
1. `MemoryMiddleware` filters messages (user inputs + final AI responses) and queues conversation
2. Queue debounces (30s default), batches updates, deduplicates per-thread
3. Background thread invokes LLM to extract context updates and facts
4. Applies updates atomically (temp file + rename) with cache invalidation, skipping duplicate fact content before append
5. Next interaction injects top 15 facts + context into `<memory>` tags in system prompt

Focused regression coverage for the updater lives in `backend/tests/test_memory_updater.py`.

**Configuration** (`config.yaml` → `memory`):
- `enabled` / `injection_enabled` - Master switches
- `storage_path` - Path to memory.json
- `debounce_seconds` - Wait time before processing (default: 30)
- `model_name` - LLM for updates (null = default model)
- `max_facts` / `fact_confidence_threshold` - Fact storage limits (100 / 0.7)
- `max_injection_tokens` - Token limit for prompt injection (2000)

### Reflection System (`packages/harness/deerflow/reflection/`)

- `resolve_variable(path)` - Import module and return variable (e.g., `module.path:variable_name`)
- `resolve_class(path, base_class)` - Import and validate class against base class

### Config Schema

**`config.yaml`** key sections:
- `models[]` - LLM configs with `use` class path, `supports_thinking`, `supports_vision`, provider-specific fields
- `tools[]` - Tool configs with `use` variable path and `group`
- `tool_groups[]` - Logical groupings for tools
- `sandbox.use` - Sandbox provider class path
- `skills.path` / `skills.container_path` - Host and container paths to skills directory
- `title` - Auto-title generation (enabled, max_words, max_chars, prompt_template)
- `summarization` - Context summarization (enabled, trigger conditions, keep policy)
- `subagents.enabled` - Master switch for subagent delegation
- `memory` - Memory system (enabled, storage_path, debounce_seconds, model_name, max_facts, fact_confidence_threshold, injection_enabled, max_injection_tokens)

**`extensions_config.json`**:
- `mcpServers` - Map of server name → config (enabled, type, command, args, env, url, headers, oauth, description)
- `skills` - Map of skill name → state (enabled)

Both can be modified at runtime via Gateway API endpoints or `DeerFlowClient` methods.

### Embedded Client (`packages/harness/deerflow/client.py`)

`DeerFlowClient` provides direct in-process access to all DeerFlow capabilities without HTTP services. All return types align with the Gateway API response schemas, so consumer code works identically in HTTP and embedded modes.

**Architecture**: Imports the same `deerflow` modules that LangGraph Server and Gateway API use. Shares the same config files and data directories. No FastAPI dependency.

**Agent Conversation** (replaces LangGraph Server):
- `chat(message, thread_id)` — synchronous, returns final text
- `stream(message, thread_id)` — yields `StreamEvent` aligned with LangGraph SSE protocol:
  - `"values"` — full state snapshot (title, messages, artifacts)
  - `"messages-tuple"` — per-message update (AI text, tool calls, tool results)
  - `"end"` — stream finished
- Agent created lazily via `create_agent()` + `_build_middlewares()`, same as `make_lead_agent`
- Supports `checkpointer` parameter for state persistence across turns
- `reset_agent()` forces agent recreation (e.g. after memory or skill changes)

**Gateway Equivalent Methods** (replaces Gateway API):

| Category | Methods | Return format |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| Models | `list_models()`, `get_model(name)` | `{"models": [...]}`, `{name, display_name, ...}` |
| MCP | `get_mcp_config()`, `update_mcp_config(servers)` | `{"mcp_servers": {...}}` |
| Skills | `list_skills()`, `get_skill(name)`, `update_skill(name, enabled)`, `install_skill(path)` | `{"skills": [...]}` |
| Memory | `get_memory()`, `reload_memory()`, `get_memory_config()`, `get_memory_status()` | dict |
| Uploads | `upload_files(thread_id, files)`, `list_uploads(thread_id)`, `delete_upload(thread_id, filename)` | `{"success": true, "files": [...]}`, `{"files": [...], "count": N}` |
| Artifacts | `get_artifact(thread_id, path)` → `(bytes, mime_type)` | tuple |

**Key difference from Gateway**: Upload accepts local `Path` objects instead of HTTP `UploadFile`, rejects directory paths before copying, and reuses a single worker when document conversion must run inside an active event loop. Artifact returns `(bytes, mime_type)` instead of HTTP Response. The new Gateway-only thread cleanup route deletes `.deer-flow/threads/{thread_id}` after LangGraph thread deletion; there is no matching `DeerFlowClient` method yet. `update_mcp_config()` and `update_skill()` automatically invalidate the cached agent.

**Tests**: `tests/test_client.py` (77 unit tests including `TestGatewayConformance`), `tests/test_client_live.py` (live integration tests, requires config.yaml)

**Gateway Conformance Tests** (`TestGatewayConformance`): Validate that every dict-returning client method conforms to the corresponding Gateway Pydantic response model. Each test parses the client output through the Gateway model — if Gateway adds a required field that the client doesn't provide, Pydantic raises `ValidationError` and CI catches the drift. Covers: `ModelsListResponse`, `ModelResponse`, `SkillsListResponse`, `SkillResponse`, `SkillInstallResponse`, `McpConfigResponse`, `UploadResponse`, `MemoryConfigResponse`, `MemoryStatusResponse`.

## Development Workflow

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) — MANDATORY

**Every new feature or bug fix MUST be accompanied by unit tests. No exceptions.**

- Write tests in `backend/tests/` following the existing naming convention `test_<feature>.py`
- Run the full suite before and after your change: `make test`
- Tests must pass before a feature is considered complete
- For lightweight config/utility modules, prefer pure unit tests with no external dependencies
- If a module causes circular import issues in tests, add a `sys.modules` mock in `tests/conftest.py` (see existing example for `deerflow.subagents.executor`)

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run a specific test file
PYTHONPATH=. uv run pytest tests/test_<feature>.py -v
```

### Running the Full Application

From the **project root** directory:
```bash
make dev
```

This starts all services and makes the application available at `http://localhost:2026`.

**Nginx routing**:
- `/api/langgraph/*` → LangGraph Server (2024)
- `/api/*` (other) → Gateway API (8001)
- `/` (non-API) → Frontend (3000)

### Running Backend Services Separately

From the **backend** directory:

```bash
# Terminal 1: LangGraph server
make dev

# Terminal 2: Gateway API
make gateway
```

Direct access (without nginx):
- LangGraph: `http://localhost:2024`
- Gateway: `http://localhost:8001`

### Frontend Configuration

The frontend uses environment variables to connect to backend services:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGGRAPH_BASE_URL` - Defaults to `/api/langgraph` (through nginx)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_BASE_URL` - Defaults to empty string (through nginx)

When using `make dev` from root, the frontend automatically connects through nginx.

## Key Features

### File Upload

Multi-file upload with automatic document conversion:
- Endpoint: `POST /api/threads/{thread_id}/uploads`
- Supports: PDF, PPT, Excel, Word documents (converted via `markitdown`)
- Rejects directory inputs before copying so uploads stay all-or-nothing
- Reuses one conversion worker per request when called from an active event loop
- Files stored in thread-isolated directories
- Agent receives uploaded file list via `UploadsMiddleware`

See [docs/FILE_UPLOAD.md](docs/FILE_UPLOAD.md) for details.

### Plan Mode

TodoList middleware for complex multi-step tasks:
- Controlled via runtime config: `config.configurable.is_plan_mode = True`
- Provides `write_todos` tool for task tracking
- One task in_progress at a time, real-time updates

See [docs/plan_mode_usage.md](docs/plan_mode_usage.md) for details.

### Context Summarization

Automatic conversation summarization when approaching token limits:
- Configured in `config.yaml` under `summarization` key
- Trigger types: tokens, messages, or fraction of max input
- Keeps recent messages while summarizing older ones

See [docs/summarization.md](docs/summarization.md) for details.

### Vision Support

For models with `supports_vision: true`:
- `ViewImageMiddleware` processes images in conversation
- `view_image_tool` added to agent's toolset
- Images automatically converted to base64 and injected into state

## Code Style
